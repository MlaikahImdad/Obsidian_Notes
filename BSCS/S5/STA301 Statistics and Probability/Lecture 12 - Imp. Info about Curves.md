## For symmetric curve
Mean = Median = Mid-range = Mid quartile range

## Right skewed curve
Median < Mid quartile range < Mid-range

## Negatively skewed
Median > Mid quartile range > Mid-range

## Chebyshev's Theorem
This theorem gives minimum proportion of data that is within "k" standard deviations of the mean.
**Formula to find this:** = $1 - \frac{1}{{{k^2}}}$ where k>1.
