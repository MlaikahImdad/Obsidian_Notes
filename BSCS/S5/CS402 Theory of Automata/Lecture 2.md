## Kleene Star Closure
Given Σ, then the Kleene Star Closure of the alphabet Σ, denoted by Σ*, is the collection of all strings defined over Σ, including Λ.
**Examples: -**
- If Σ = {x} Then Σ* = {Λ, x, xx, xxx, xxxx, ....}
- If Σ = {0,1} Then Σ* = {Λ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, ....}

> Languages generated by Kleene Star Closure of set of strings, are infinite languages. (By infinite language, it is supposed that the language contains infinite many words, each of finite length).

## PLUS Operation (+)
Plus Operation is same as Kleene Star Closure except that it does not generate Λ (null string), automatically.
**Examples: -**
- If Σ = {aab, c} Then ${\Sigma ^ + }$ = {aab, c, aabaab, aabc, caab, cc, ....}

> a* can be considered to be all possible strings defined over {a}, which shows that a* generates Λ, a, aa, aaa, ...
  ${a^+}$ can be considered to be all possible non empty strings defined over {a}, which shows that a+ generates a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ...
