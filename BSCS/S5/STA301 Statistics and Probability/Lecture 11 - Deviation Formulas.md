This document contains information about the following terms. Mainly, It has the formulas.
* Mean deviation
* Standard deviation
* Coefficient of variation

## Mean Deviation
Mean deviation can be found using 2 methods.
1. Mean average
2. Median
### For un-grouped data
Mean deviation: $d = X-\overline{X}$ *(Using mean average)*
Mean deviation: $d = X - \widetilde X$ *(Using median)*

**Mean Average** = $\overline X  = \frac{{\sum X }}{n}$
    Here X can be mid-point already given or we've to find. Or can't be mid-point
**Median**: -
    * Arrange the data in ascending order.
    * Find the middle of data
        * If data is odd: The middle value is median.
        * If data is even: The average of 2 middle values is median.

> You'll notice that the sum of deviation is 0. So, to avoid this, we've to remove the sign from it. And we'll do this using mod. |d|=|$X-\overline{X}$| or |$X - \widetilde X$|

**For Grouped data**
- Mean average = $\overline X  = \frac{{\sum {fX} }}{{\sum f }}$

## Co-efficient of Mean Deviation
